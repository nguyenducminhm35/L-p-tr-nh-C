<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
<p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
<p>The Cvottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back foer centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions versions were formed as a
    reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>English estata gardens</u></p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetable and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
